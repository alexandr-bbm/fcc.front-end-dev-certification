# freecodecamp.pomodoro-timer

## Description

The task was to fill the following user stories: 
 
1. I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.

2.  I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.

3. I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

Full task can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock).

The [solution](https://alexandr-bbm.github.io/freecodecamp.pomodoro-timer/) with use of react architecture tends to be maintainable and extensible.
I would appreciate any comment about the code.
